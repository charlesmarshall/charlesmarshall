      <h1>Welcome...</h1>
      <p>I've been working in the web industry for many years now;  offically old enough to remember when IE6 was new, shiney and actually better than its rivals. The dark ages of IE dominance have, thankfully, come &amp; gone, leaving us with a better, more competitive market and lots of new technology to play with.</p>
      <p>In my current role at <a href="http://oneblackbear.com">One Black Bear</a> I build on these technologies to make quality websites, products like our CMS and much more.</p>

      <h2><a href="/wildfire/">Wildfire CMS</a></h2>
      <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/wildfire/"><img src="/wildfire/7/logo.png" alt="Wildfire"></a>
      <p>Our trusted <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/wildfire/">CMS</a> has been around for quite a while now, since late 2006. Back then we used subversion, and you can see the very first commit to this day on our <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/wildfire/commit/db8611fa521e1dd273f65bafa275d39d3a8bda58">Git repo</a>.</p>
      <p>Technology always moves on and just as we moved to Git from subversion, Wildfire has had its fair share of architecture changes as well. In the early days it was a very basic setup just serving blog pages, these days it powers huge sites like <a href="http://nxbus.co.uk">National Express buses</a> &amp; <a href="http://subaru.co.uk">Subaru</a>.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The <a href="/wildfire/7.1/">new version</a> is being polished and made ready for its production debut, but in the meantime I've scratched a nostalgic itch and put together a <a href="/wildfire/">timeline of the project</a>.</p>
