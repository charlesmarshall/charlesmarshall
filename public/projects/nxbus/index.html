      <h1>National Express Buses</h1>
      <p>We've just launched the brand new national express buses website. It has some very nice new features, such as the live service alerts system, maps of the routes, and an overall improved interface, searching and of course tech.</p>

      <h2>Making changes</h2>
      <p>Previously all the areas had their own individual websites, domains, admin area and were totally separated. With this new site we have merged all of the previous sites under the single domain, so each share a common identity, layout, structure and functionality.</p>
      <p>Since the original design we have added some illustrated cityscapes matching the section of the you are viewing; so the bullring shows up for the west midlands, desperate dan for dundee etc.</p>
      <p>To go with these we have also got a mobile version of the website coming out very soon.</p>

    <section class='feature' id="tech">
      <h2>Tech used</h2>
      <p>In previous posts I’ve mentioned changes like swapping apache for nginx and the improvements to the framework, well those are all in use on national express and working nicely.</p>
      <p>Combining both layout cache with partial cache mechanism also means that (unless the cache is cleared) all pages are served from the cache with load times and size being tiny.</p>
      <p>YSlow gives the site between 89 and 93 out of 100, depending on the page. Pretty good performance!</p>
