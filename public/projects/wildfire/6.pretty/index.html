      <h1>Wildfire CMS version 6.pretty</h1>
      <p>This was mostly a visual upgrade, going from the old style that had been around for a couple of iterations to a new darker version. A few bugs were ironed out here and there along with some general performance fixes./p>

      <h2>Delete hammer</h2>
      <p>The fun part of any big revision; clearing out all that excess code and trying to trim it down to the bare bones ready to start again. Back in Feburary 2011 I began the adventure of changing everything by <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/wildfire/commit/12b34b2693b94459f75535b16e68bb359f25d0ba">clearing out lots of references to sections, joins that won't be needed</a> etc.</p>
      <p>Carrying on the code culling for a few more days and then starting to unfiy various names (so any date field starts with date_ rather than them swapping around) and changing the calls to match.</p>
