      <h1>Wildfire CMS Overview</h1>
      <p>An <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/wildfire/">open source PHP CMS</a> that I've been helping to build for several years now. Starting back in 2006 it has come a long way since then and is currently on version 7.</p>
      <p>The CMS itself runs on top of a <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/phpwax">PHP MVC framework called PHP-Wax</a>, which <a href="/projects/phpwax/">I also help to develop</a>. </p>

    <section class="feature" id="wildfire-7">
      <h2><a href="/projects/wildfire/7/">Wildfire version 7</a></h2>
      <a href="/projects/wildfire/7/"><img src="/projects/wildfire/6.pretty/logo.png" alt="Wildfire version 7 logo"></a>
      <div class='inner'>
        <p>Version 7 has big changes under the hood. Faster, new templating abilities and a brand new agnostic media system to replace the old files area.</p>
        <p>The new media area provides access to media stored on services such as youtube, vimeo and flickr. More adaptors can just be dropped in as they are needed.</p>

      <div class='inner'>
        <p>A significant visual upgrade to the original <a href="/projects/wildfire/6/">version 6</a>, getting a rather nice dark skin to replace my rough and ready attempts for 6.pretty.</p>

      <div class='inner'>
        <p>A massive rewrite. This version of the CMS moved away from the older section &amp; content division and brought the two together in to a unified model; using a typical tree like interface.</p>
        <p>Not only did all the back end change, but so did the interface, although it did keep the orange and black stylings of its predecessor.</p>
