measuring by populace is flawed for transport network
- densely populated areas need fewer stops per person
- if 2000 people live within 100m they only need single stop
- if 2000 people live within 1k then need more stops

measure by distance from bus stop if possible
- census data with postcode areas maybe?
- based on ranges (<10m, 10-50m) etc
- average per area and graph mapping it, showing uneven bell curves etc

should be a fairer comparision
