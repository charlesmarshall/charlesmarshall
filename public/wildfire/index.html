      <h1>Wildfire CMS Overview</h1>
      <p>An <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/wildfire/">open source PHP CMS</a> that I've been helping to build for several years now. Starting back in 2006 it has come a long way since then and is currently on version 7.</p>
      <p>The CMS itself runs on top of a <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/phpwax">PHP MVC framework called PHP-Wax</a>, which I also help to develop. </p>

      <h2><a href="/wildfire/7/">Wildfire version 7</a></h2>
      <a href="/wildfire/7/"><img src="/wildfire/7/logo.png" alt="Wildfire version 7 logo"></a>
      <div class='inner'>
        <p>While the styling on this version is the same, there are big changes under the hood. Faster, new templating abilities and a brand new agnostic media system to replace the old files area.</p>
        <p>The new media area provides access to media stored on services such as youtube, vimeo and flickr. More adaptors can just be dropped in as they are needed.</p>
