      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <h4 class='date'>21<sup>st</sup> April 2014</h4>
      <p>Although it might not be obvious, Droplet is much more than a smart phone application. Behind the scenes we run an in-depth admin area, a RESTfull API, an auth process, email system, blog and more. As you can imagine, they all have different needs, different usage amounts and, of course, different peak times.</p>
      <p>We currently run these over various host machines and use a central message queue system to pass data around and communicate with other elements of our eco-system. This distributed layout allows for a good amount of flexibility and scaling, but at the moment there is still a lot of manual intervention required and can be difficult to replicate in a development environment.</p>
      <p>Over the last year or so there has been a large amount new software coming out trying to solve these kinds of infrastructure problems, even a new acronym, PaaS, to cover this new field of DevOps work. Once particular piece of software, called Docker, has been the driving force behind a large number of these projects, such as Flynn, Deis and Shipyard. </p>
      <p>Docker itself is an extension of linux containers, but with all the hard work simplified down to a series of simple commands and very useful configuration file. By using this as a base, you the ability to create multiple, self-contained, environments running any sequence of commands you want. It can be a simple consumer process that reads something off our message queue, or something more complex like a website running via nginx.</p>
      <p>On top of that, these PaaS tools add a level of management and distribution, allowing you to spread over multiple physical or virtualised machines.  Of course, this creates another problem, how does A know about B. That is where a service discovery element is needed. There are a few of these available, such as etcd and Zookeeper. </p>
      <p>In general, these call a central point to (normally a tokenised web service) to register themselves and find out what other hosts are available. Once connected, they can fetch a simple set of key value data pairs, these will normally be things to do with responsbility (which host does what) and availability (which host is online).</p>
      <p>After that, all you need to do is direct traffic to the correct place via a 'conductor' process. This is normally some form of reverse proxy, like nginx or haproxy.</p>
