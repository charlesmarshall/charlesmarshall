"A site designed to show case the work":http://freetofreelance.co.uk and be as mininal as possible. Clean and simple with just black text and a white background in order to keep the focus on the work being shown.

Large images (800 x 600) dominate the website with a cool little jQuery image switcher. Based on PHP-WAX and Wildfire CMS its smart & simple to use.

EDIT (Oct 14 2009): The site has now had a visual update; in return for some carrot cake, see "Miss Jones":"/work/2009/10/14/miss-jones.html" for more info.

EDIT (May 20 2009): Bit of a rebrand, the sites primary domain is now "nataliefayejones.co.uk":"http://nataliefayejones.co.uk"
