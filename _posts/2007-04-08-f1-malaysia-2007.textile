Sepang was the first of the new generation of Hermann Tilke-designedracetracks, and it made a big impression when it joined the Formula 1calendar in 1999.p. With its wide expanses, sweeping corners and state-of-the-artfacilities, the state-funded Malaysian circuit on the outskirts ofKuala Lumpur provided a blueprint for the many new grand prix tracksthat would spring up in ever more diverse corners of the world over thenext decade.p. It also gave an insight into the difficulties of establishing an F1 venue in a country with little motorsport heritage.p. But the organisers do not complain about the lack of a large andpassionate crowd, instead seeing the grand prix as an excellent way toadvertise Malaysia as an international tourist destination.p. Sepang's first ever F1 race in '99 was its most memorable, asMichael Schumacher made a remarkable comeback after three months on thesidelines with a broken leg.p. He took pole position and dominated until handing victory to his title-chasing team-mate Eddie Irvine.p. Highlights of subsequent years included Kimi Raikkonen's maiden winin 2003 and Jenson Buttonâ%u20AC?%u201E?s long-awaited first podium the followingseason.p. The circuitâ%u20AC?%u201E?s wide straights leading into tight corners have alwaysprompted lively wheel-to-wheel racing - and inevitably somecontroversial collisions as well.h4. Race Results&nbsp;Fernando AlonsoLewis HamiltonKimi RaikkonenNick HeidfeldFelipe MassaGiancarlo FisichellaJarno TrulliHeikki Kovalainenp. Second place for Lewis! Great result for the rookie! Just a dam shame Alonso pipped him to the win, but what a start to his first season; fresh hope for a Bristish champion? p. After a great performance in Oz the Ferraris seemed to be slightly lacking and only managed 3rd and 5th.
