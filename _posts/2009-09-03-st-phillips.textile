Not a site I can take credit for, Ross Riley built this one, but it's just around the corner so well worth a mention.

We've just finished and pushed live an over hauled and "revamped version of their website":http://www.st-philips.com/, but not on our CMS. 

As this site will be maintained internally by their IT department it's being built using activeedition instead. I'm not a fan.
