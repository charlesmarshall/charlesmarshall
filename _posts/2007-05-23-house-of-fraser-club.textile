The new "membership site":http://houseoffraserclub.co.uk for House of Fraser was mostly made by my colleague "John Walker":http://www.coffeerings.co.uk, I helped with the original layout and css.

EDIT (Aug 12 2009): Looks like that site has been turned off and now longer in use. Not really a shock as employers at the time ("WAA":http://waa.co.uk) lost the contract.
