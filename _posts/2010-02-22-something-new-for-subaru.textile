I can't go in much detail, but we've been quietly working away on a new website for Subaru UK; that's one of the reasons I've been so quiet recently. I've been working primarily on the new accessories section, but also helping out where needed.

The new features don't stop with just the website though; 360 photography and accessory data are all running from the "IM Group API":/work/2009/09/29/im-group-api.html sitting there for anyone authenticated person to use.

When I've not been doing that I've been working on the new "Isuzu dealer websites":http://dealer.oneblackbear.com which uses some lovely css3 features to do gradients and nice touches like that.
