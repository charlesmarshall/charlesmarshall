!/images/work/subaru-home.jpg(Subaru UK)!You might of noticed that it has been quite a while since I posted anything new in the work section; I haven't been slacking off, honest! What has been taking up my time in between launching dealer websites (we now have 3 versions, "original subaru":http://www.exetersubaru.co.uk/, "new style subaru site":http://subaruvehicles.co.uk/ and of course the "isuzu dealer":http://isuzu.alexandra-cars.co.uk/ sites) has been the work towards the new Subaru UK site.

*As of yesterday (13/01/2010) "this new version went live":http://subaru.co.uk!*

Most of the One Black Bear team have been working on the the Subaru UK project in some form. A large amount of my work for the project was spent adding functionality and content to the existing API, in particular adding all of the accessories information.

The accessories are currently being limited to the most recent models, but are quite extensive in what they cover with almost everything you could expect to see on a Subaru being shown.

As well as the accessories back end I also developed the accessories section with a pretty new interface allowing filtering, searching, baskets and generating requests to your local dealership.

Some of my favourite features of the new site is the 360 images and the range selector.
