You'd think that in this modern age of computers, the internet,inter-connectivity and nationalised databases that finding information about a property would be merely a few mouse clicks away.p. How wrong could I have been!p. After providing them with the complete address (not just a guessed one mind you, but the official full address straight from Royal Mail) surely finding the property would be easy.p. Postcode, no luck there; full address; still can't find it. What more do they want, the longitude and latitude? Eventually after hounding the letting agent I finally got hold of the previous account number and hey presto, they found it.p. This problem was repeated at almost every one of the utility providers I contacted. Maybe it was something I was doing, but then how did other companies find my flat straight away?p. After a little bit of investigation I found the crux of the problem.Approximately 18 months ago the building that is now my block of flatswas a field.p. It seems that these large, national companies simply weren'tupdating their information. Why is this? Budget cuts? Poor practices?Laziness? Ignorance?p. With an ever increasing demanding for new housing (practicallymodern flats) this seems a worrying trend. Does this mean that everynew house or block of flats wont appear on the books of basic utilityprovides for over a year?p. Maybe it was just my flat; maybe I moved in in-between them updatingtheir databases; maybe I'm just unlucky. If not, they really need tore-evaluate their business practices and update! Well, that is my rantover for this week!
