	<p>A long time ago I created a very handy little site called tiny js ; it was all about small but powerful javascript plugins for libraries such as jQuery.</p>

	<p>At one point it made it in to an <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/21/50-fresh-javascript-tools-that-will-improve-your-workflow/">article on Smashing Magazine regarding javascript tools</a>, resources etc.</p>

	<p>I simply haven't had the time to sort out the niggling bugs (git syncing for example) or give it the revamp it needed. The plans were grand, but never realised and I've now closed the site down</p>

	<p>All of the plugins are still available on the <a href="https://github.com/tinyjs">github page</a>.</p>
