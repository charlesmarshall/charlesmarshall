The time is almost here for the Multipacks semi regular (hopefully will be regular, this will be the 2nd time) summer time extravaganza; "Geek in the Park":http://geekinthepark.co.uk!p. As previously the event is aimed at geeks and their families with the day being split in to two; the afternoon picnic and the evening talk

The afternoon picnic last time was a resounding success with lots of people from all over the country coming down to point and laugh at us trying to play football... The only downside being a lost Frisbee and an almost lost ball (this time we'll try not to play by the river, honest!). Thanks again to the rowers for rescuing the ball

This years evening talk is aimed at being a bit more interactive and we should have some great speakers (once its all confirmed). So keep an eye on "the website":http://geekinthepark.co.uk and come on over for some geek fun in the sun (hopefully!).
