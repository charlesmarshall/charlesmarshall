This was previously "Free to Freelance":http://freetofreelance.co.uk but has now undergone some design changes and new content.

The new name and font are obvious but there is now a "testimonials section":http://nataliefayejones.co.uk/testimonials along with a more detailed "information page":http://nataliefayesjones.co.uk/information.

Switching to italic georgia for headings has given the site that little bit extra visual appeal and looks much closer to the new branding.

If you ever need any creative things (logos, company branding etc) then Miss Jones is lady you want!
