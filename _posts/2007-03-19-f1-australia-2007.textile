---layout: posttitle: F1 - Australia 2007category: motorsport---Start of a new season and Ferrari have got off to a cracking start. Not the best day for Massa (dropping to 20th after a gearbox change) but he did manage to get all the way up to 6th place and score some points. With a win for Kimmi the season looks good for the Ferrari faithful.Youngster Lewis Hamilton put in a sterling performance to get on the podium on his first outing into F1 and spent most of the race showing Alonso exactly why Ron Dennis has so much faith in him.Hopefully the points will keep coming for Lewis as with Button stuck in an under performing Honda he is the main British interest this season. Unfortunately that does come with all that pressure and hassle from the media; lets just hope they will leave him in peace to do this thing on the track.Other notable points: The MacLaren is still the most beautiful car on the track and this season seems to have some speed and substance to back up its looks. Wurz was almost decapitated by the under-tray of Coultards Red Bull in a daring (if slightly foolish) over taking attempt.
