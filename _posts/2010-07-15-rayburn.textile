introduction: "<p>A name I remember, as I grew up a few miles away from their head office! Rayburn is a brand name even I know; sellers of range cookers all over the country, but based in my home town of Telford.</p>"

Even though I was born only a few miles away it was my colleague "Sheldon Els":http://sheldon.github.com/ who built this one, but as I'm a local lad I thought I'd blog about it anyway!

This time, the client is handling the hosting and further work themselves, so its been built on software they request; umbraco. Not a bad cms, but .net is still overly complicated.

Doing simple things like recursive and nested navigations take more time than can believe, but on the whole the interface is reasonable, updated regularly and pretty stable. 

The end result is good, the "new version of the website is up and looking good":http://rayburn-web.co.uk/!
