Recently I came across a very strange issue while converting an existing website. As I'm just porting it over to our framework no design or styling work was required, so I'd just been copying the header and footer files into our layout system when I noticed something. 

This site was using HTML 4.01 and all the stylesheet links had a title attribute, this trigged an obscure issue I had never encounted before. According in the HTML 4 spec setting a title attribute converts the stylesheet to a preferred stylesheets and only one of these can be loaded in at any time. This meant a whole bunch of styling would disappear even though its clearly visible in firebug etc. For more information take a look at "this article":https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Correctly_Using_Titles_With_External_Stylesheets.
