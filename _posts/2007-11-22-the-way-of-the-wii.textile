Good old fashioned playabilty finally strikes back. After many years of graphical improvements, interface development and soaring price tags Nintendo decided enough was enough. Instead of playing the next generation game they took a step back and realised something... Gaming should be fun.p. Where SONY and Microsoft went about created bigger, meaner machines with high end graphic cards and enough technology to carry such weighty tags as 'home entertainment console' and 'THE home theatre solution' Nintendo went a different way.p. Using the existing Gamecube platform Nintendo went about doing what they do best; they changed the way we played games. Instead of using clunky controllers they came up with a small tv remote style controller and then came the killer feature....p. Your motions controller aspects of the games! The days of button bashing are over, now to beat some jumped up kid on the Wii you need some muscle in places other then your fingers. After playing 4 player Wii tennis i woke up the next day with sore arm muscles! p. Forget the real life graphics, fun and game play wins every time!
