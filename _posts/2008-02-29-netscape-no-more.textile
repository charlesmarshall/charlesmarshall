As of the 1st of March 2008 Netscape is offically dead and buried. That date is the last day parent company AOL will support the browser. p. Netscpape was one of the first modern generation browsers with, at it's peak, over 90% of people using it (in the days of 4.7!) but has recently slumped to a miniscule 0.6%. This huge swing in fortune was the decisve factor and the end of Navigator was set ast year by the various boards and mangement at AOL.p. Netscape Navigator was a very important piece of software laying down the ground rules for almost every other browser including the IE series and will go do in history. p. In spirit it will on in the form of Firefox, Flock and various other Mozilla based browsers. The Mozillia foundation was created by former Netscape staff who were made redundant in 2003; since then they have once again had large scale success with Firefox now corning over 20% of the worlds browsers.
