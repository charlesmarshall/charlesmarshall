Several months ago the amazingly popular website Flickr opened up its service and functionality to the general public by means of an impressive API. Of course a large proportion of the internet users don't know what an API is never mind feel the need to use one.

However, as part of the php-wax framework development I created a very basic plugin to use the Flickr API. You can see an example of its use on the front page of this website. Once the framework has been released and out of beta I will write a proper article about its uses with code examples.
