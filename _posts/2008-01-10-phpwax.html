	<p>The PHP MVC framework that I've been working on with others since 2008 ish. I've yet to go in to details on it, but have a look at <a href="http://php-wax.com/phpwax/">our docs (out of date now)</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/phpwax/">source code</a> itself.</p>

	<p>We're currently on v3.2</p>
