title: Tesla Starts Production!
category: general
---
At long last the Tesla all electric sports car went in to production today! Huge news for all those petrolheads with a green heart. The Roadster is based on a Lotus Elise chassis so should be a dream to drive and if the published statistics are accurate very fast, hitting 60mph in just under 4 seconds.

The other plus point of the Tesla is the fuel economy of 135mpg! The 2008 batch have already been sold and I'm looking forward to reading the first road test. For now take a look at the "pistonheads page":http://petrolheads.com/news/default.asp?storyId=17766 or the "companies own website":http://www.teslamotors.com/.
