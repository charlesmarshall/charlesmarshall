"Localyser is an attempt to crowd-source postcode to address lookups":http://localyser.com and thus start to avoid Royal Mail's monopoly on what should be public data.

It's simple to include on your site and provides free postcode to address lookups in return for your sharing of similar data.

Installing is easy, a Google Analytics style javascript snippet gets you up and running immediately and there's an API too for more in depth usage.

All the data is free for any use under the Creative Commons license.
