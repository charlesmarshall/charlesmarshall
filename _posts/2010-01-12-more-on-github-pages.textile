title: More Git Hub Pages...
category: web

Last year I moved my blog over to use "git hub pages":http://pages.github.com which makes use of liquid & jekyll to compile your website to a static version.

Git hub pages have now become my choice for any simple project website (just like my little front end to "google's closure optimiser":http://closureoptimizer.com/) and to that end I've found a whole bunch of useful resources which will hopefully save digging around in the future.

* "Guide to liquid":http://wiki.github.com/tobi/liquid/liquid-for-designers
* "Standard template variables":http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/template-data
* "Basic functions":http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/liquid-extensions

So now I know how to use them well; just need to make a better design for this blog!
