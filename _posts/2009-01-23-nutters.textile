I only wish I'd managed to get a photo. While walking home from the new office last night I saw a group of people congregating around a van at the back end of Albert Street car park. Considering all the recent protests about Gaza et al it wasn't anything special. However, when I got closer I started to hear someone preaching at the crowd; another bunch of overly zealous deity lovers that I'd have to politely turn down their literature, just what I needed on a cold, wet night

I was wrong, no sign of omnipotent beings at all, just a big banner which said something like "A touch from The King will cure all addictions!"... Yes, thats right, Elvis worshipers! Even worse than bible bashers!

I quietly sniggered to myself, kept my distance and thought to myself 'Don't Be Cruel' as 'You'll Never Walk Alone' 'In the Ghetto' and I didn't want to get attacked by that 'Hard Headed Woman' with the megaphone nevermind the 'Big Boss Man' as I value my 'Life'.
