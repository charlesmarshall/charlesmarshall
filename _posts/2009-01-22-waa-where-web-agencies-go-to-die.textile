The WAA vultures have been circling again. In a "recent press release":http://thedrum.co.uk/news/2009/01/21/9404-waa-takes-on-staff-and-clients-as-twist-closes they announced new staff members; former employees of the recently insolvent Twist Communications. 

Having never heard of them and just going by the cached version of their website it looks like a small time flash company from the middle of nowhere (at least according to the phone area code). 

This spell of buying companies for specific clients seems to suggest WAA are trying bulk out their client list again after several clients leaving them. After a bout of redundancies and now speculative purchases, maybe the future isn't so bright in Sutton Coldfield.
