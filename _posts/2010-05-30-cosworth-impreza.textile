!/images/work/cosworth-impreza.jpg(Cosworth Impreza)!If you've been keeping up on the latest motoring news you will have heard about this already. Although I can't tell you anything about the car (yet), I can tell you it will be making an appearance on the website very soon.

After everything is up and running on the main Subaru site we will pushing it out to all the dealer sites we run; so it wont be long till you can pester your nearest dealership about trying one.
