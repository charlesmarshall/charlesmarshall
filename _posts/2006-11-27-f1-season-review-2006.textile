With the retirement of undoubtedly the greatest driver of the modern age (regardless of his misdemeanours) it would have been poetic justice if he'd gone out in style by winning an 8th title.However, this was not the case. With only a few races remaining it was a very close call between Schumi and Alonso; unfortunately a rare engine failure gifted it to Alonso.If you look back though the season then maybe you could point out some mistakes (by Ferrari and Michael) that cost points and possibly even the championship. But this would take away from the astounding performances and pure driving genius that he graced us with this year and during his illustrious career.On several occasions "the master" shocked us with brilliant over taking, amazing grit and determination along with stunning race performances. In some cases coming from the tail end of the grid to get his car in the points!Unfortunately there were some lows. One in particular might cast a shadow of disapproval over his last season, maybe even his entire career. The incident at Monte Carlo. Tactical, yes, sportsman-like, no.If it had worked, it would have been great for Ferrari. But it didn't.Incidents like this occurred though out his career. That is the flaw of the champion. The desire to win at all costs, regardless of others.Should we persecute him for this? No, after all he is only human and we all make mistakes. Thankfully for most of us 10 million plus people aren't watching us when we make them.Whether you love him or loath him, the sport wont be the same without him. No offence to Alonso, but he just doesn't have the same level of notoriety or skill as Michael. Without the 7-time champion the sport no longer has that exciting figurehead that inspires the fans.With the rumour mill working over time, talk is already circulating about Michael going back to Renault for one last season, maybe even creating his own team with Ross Braun (the architect of many Shumi wins). Who knows what will happen (Bernie?), but I doubt we've seen the last of Michael Schumacer.This season wasn't just about the title race. With new winners and sterling performances from young drivers there is hope for next season.Button winning his first race has to be one of the best moments this year for British motor sport. Massa out-qualifying his team mate on more then one occasion. Kimi moving to Ferrari. Alonso going to McClaren. 2007 should be an interesting year.Go Ferrari!
