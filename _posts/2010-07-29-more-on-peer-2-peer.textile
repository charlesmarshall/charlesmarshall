So after my previous post, I did start (and mostly finished) a python app engine torrent server using memcache. The main thing left to do is sort out the compressed view... I've been very busy (more about that later), details in the post.

I've used a cross between a 2 existing python code bases (neither of which I can remember at the moment, will find them and include links later). The first was a memcache cut down version of the torrent protocal, the second was a fully fledged gql version.  I've mixed the 2 together to make a full torrent server based on memcache.

Have a look at "my github project page":http://github.com/charlesmarshall/tracker for the code base.

As soon as I get round to finishing it I will write a more detailed post!
