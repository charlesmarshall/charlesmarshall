title: Useful Bash Shell Scripts
category: general
---

Bash is a type of shell; you will find it sitting on almost every nix based computer you can get your hands on. To check if your running @bash@ type in this on your command prompt

@echo $SHELL@

If it returns something like

@/bin/bash@

Then you are. There are alternatives to bash; C Shell (@csh@) and Bourne Shell (@sh@) being popular ones.

Anyway, getting to the point ... 

h3. Scripting

I wrote some bash scripts to help with setting up websites; I know the current trend is to use @Capistrano@ but not everyone wants to install all of it's dependancies.

Currently, there is one main script called @sitecreate.sh@, this takes in an bunch of arguments and then goes off and calls utility scripts in the same directory. As long as you get the command right, the following happens: 

h4. user.sh

* Shell in to remote server
* Create group for user
* Create user & home directory
* Add user to group
* Setup users password

h4. vhost.sh

* Reads in and parses a vhost skeleton file
* Saves parsed vhost to apache directory

h4. mysql.sh

* Create mysql user
* Create mysql database
* Give user permissions to the db

h4. checkout.sh
* Checks out the projects GiT repository

Once all of those are done, it then restarts apache. The scripts aren't fully tested yet, but feel free to "grab them over at github":http://github.com/charlesmarshall/Utils
