Another insurance broker that we started way back when (approx. April 2007). This site has been though at least 3 re-designs with each one being signed off, approved, built and then client changing their minds at the last stage!

I only seem to have the original and current designs at hand; not sure where the second version went to but it is some what similar to the current iteration, minus the top navigation bar. 

As this was built and populated ages ago this is running an older version of the Wildfire CMS but is a relatively straight forward site, nothing to complicated.

(This site was also worked on by Ross Riley, "John Walker":http://www.coffeerings.co.uk/ and Sheldon Els)

EDIT (Oct 10 2009): Wow, I'm shocked that it hasn't been changed again!
