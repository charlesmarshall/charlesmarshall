One of more interactive projects of late required an image to be moved around as if the user was dragging it. There was also a good chance that it would need to be combined with some other effects such as a zoom feature an image switcher. p. Currently, most draggable image plugins use an inline image with absolute positioning and a surrounding clipping area, which in most cases is fine, but in this case it would be a real issue as the zoom plugin uses an absolute positioned container. To get around this I decided to convert the image inside the container to the background image.p. For all those people who don't have javascript turned on you just see a clipped image, but those with javascript can move the background image around as if they are dragging it.

As ever all of these jQuery gubbins can be found over at the jQuery plugin site.
