As 'smart phone' usage & popularity increases so does the number of people surfing the web via such a device. With information & asset heavy sites it makes sense to have a simplified version for those as the normal mobile connection is a bit rough around the edges.

As part of Bloor Homes project we've "now launched the mobile site":http://m.bloorhomes.com/ to suit those users who are on flakey 3G and don't want to load up large images etc.
