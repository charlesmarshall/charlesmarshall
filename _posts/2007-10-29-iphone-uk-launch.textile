The time is here, the iPhone is now available in the UK! Now I might be a burgeoning Mac fan boy but even I wont pay the best part of &pound;300 for a phone regardless of how cool it is.

When it gets to a sensible price level (ie free or very cheap on contract like most phones) and has 3G facilities instead of EDGE with a larger hard drive then I will definitely have one!
