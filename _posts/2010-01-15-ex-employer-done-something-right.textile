As I never seem to have the time to blog about much any more; it's taken me far too long to mention this.

WAA used to have a reasonable website (I didn't like all the pink). It was, most importantly, a valid XHTML site with only a single bit of flash. This version of their site had plenty of content, was updated regularly (until Chris Tomlinson left) with a really good page rank in google (If memory serves it was a 6).

What replaced it (not long after I left) was an abortion of a flash website, which I have already berated in an earlier post. Flash websites can still do well, if content is exposed properly. Theirs wasn't. The number of times it was updated you could count on a single hand and they had removed pretty much every single article that had ever been written for that site. This is old ground; I've already moaned about it many times.

Towards the end of last year (2009) they launched a new website; and it wasn't flash! Instead it is a good quality html website (no so keen on the design) with some fresh content. A positive move for a change; lets see what happens.
