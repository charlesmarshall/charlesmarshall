"MADE":http://made-schools.org is the new name for NAMDS and is a group of 9 schools within the UK that stand for excellence in music and dance (in fact thats what MADE stands for - Music And Dance Excellence). They commissioned "One Black Bear":http://oneblackbear.com to build them a new site, and that's what we did! 

One of the nicest designs I've worked on recently, take a look at "made-schools.org":http://made-schools.org and see what you think.
