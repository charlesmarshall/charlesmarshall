Having endured many months of problems getting things connected andaccounts activated (take a look at my earlier rant about utilities) Ihad become accustomed to pathetic customer services. However, Bulldogbeat them all.p. Somewhere along the line the 'big wigs' at Bulldog would of had toformulate a strategy for resolving customer queries. It looks like thismeeting was a very short one. Their answer to everything; outsource toIndia! Yes, thats right, another company jumping on that band wagon.p. Due to restrictions imposed upon me by my landlord (no cable allowed:( ) I was left with very few choices for an ADSL provider. I opted forthe best of a bad bunch, Bulldog. That is when things started to gowrong.p. The connection took 6 weeks to be sorted, instead of the maximum of 4 stated on the website and on the letter. Strike 1!p. Fitting day came, credit where credit is due, the engineer was earlyand switched on the socket nice and quickly. Now according to theletters, emails and the assurances of the fitter, the line should beactive within 4 hours.p. Five hours later, nothing. Time to call the helpline.p. Strike 2! Useless in the extreme. With great lines like "if you wantto complain about your lack of internet connection you will need tosend an email to..." and "have you checked your connection statusonline?" it is difficult for me to comprehend how these people survive.p. At this point I was getting somewhat annoyed, clearly those 'bigwigs' who made these procedures lack some common sense. How exactly doyou send an email or look at a website when they haven't got round topulling their collective finger out and switching on my line!p. I called back later on in the evening before the so called "support"line closed. Strike 3 and in a big way! This time the bouffon on theother end claims "if it is not on now sir, it probably wont be untilmonday". Time to get the supervisor!p. After a brief vent of some more choice points that I wanted them tofully understand in no uncertain terms (mostly arguments about themlying in their correspondence and delaying of services equating tobreaches of contract) I calmed down slightly.p. In hindsight the most worrying and down right rude part of thisescapade was that not a single member of the support staff everapologised or even showed the slightest form of remorse. Yes, I was attimes slightly abrupt and even bras, but only because I was getting nowhere!p. Maybe in the future those same 'big wigs' will sit down and decidethat if their customer service was better and actually helpful theymight shrug off the bad image, get more customers and make money thatway instead of cutting corners by giving everything to the lowestbidder.p. At the moment, my internet connection is running well and I have nocomplaints about that thankfully, as I really do not relish having tospeak to "support" again!p. Rant over and out .. for now..
