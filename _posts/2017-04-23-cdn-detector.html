<section class='container'>
	<p>While working on a recent web project I found the need to easily see if the a website was being cached correctly via a CDN (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront">AWS CloudFront</a> in this case). While I could do this easily with a quick curl command to view the headers, this was not possible for the client.</p>
	<p>To get around this I created a Chrome extension that provides a colour coded icon and some basic info about CDN usage. When it detects a CDN hit, the icon goes green, if its a miss, it is red and the default state is grey.</p>

	<p>Where possible, it provides the UTC time that the page was cached.<p>

	<h2>Analytics</h2>
	<p>At the moment, the extension uses Google Analytics to track Hits &amp; Misses, but does not pass along any other information.</p>

	<p>This can be disabled in the options, or you can change the profile that information is being sent to.</p>

	<h2>Going Forward</h2>
	<p>I will add more CDN's to the list that the extension can detect and display some statistics about the usage.</p>
