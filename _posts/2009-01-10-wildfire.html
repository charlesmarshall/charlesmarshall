<div class="container">

	<p>An <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/wildfire/">open source PHP CMS</a> that I've been helping to build for several years now. Starting back in 2006 it has come a long way since then and is currently on version 7.</p>

	<p>The CMS itself runs on top of a <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/phpwax">PHP MVC framework called PHP-Wax</a>, which <a href="/projects/phpwax/">I also help to develop</a>. </p>

	<p>There is an ever growing list of plugins to help do the more standard and mundane tasks like <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/wildfire.archive-navigation">archive navigation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/wildfire.meta">meta details</a>, <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/wildfire.sitemap">sitemaps</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/phpwax/wildfire.rss">RSS feeds</a></p>

	<p>Wildfire is currently on version 7.1</p>
