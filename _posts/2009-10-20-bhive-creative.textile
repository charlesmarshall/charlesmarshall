At the start of this year a group of like minded people from various companies 'in the business' got together and decided to do something about the migration of new talent from the midlands to rival cities such as London & Manchester.

An idea was born. "B-Hive":http://bhive-creative.com. 

The B-Hive scheme has been developed to give students from the city’s universities and colleges the opportunity to get a foot on the career ladder by winning paid work placements at some of the region’s leading companies.

We have just relaunched the B-Hive site ready for next years entries, it is now much bigger than before with news sections, advice, and much more. 

If you are curious, you can still see the "2009 version here":http://2009.bhive-creative.com/.
