Some months back I created a very handy little site called "tiny js":http://tinyjs.com ; it's all about small but powerful javascript plugins for libraries such as jQuery. I only just noticed that I didn't blog about it on here, very bad of me!

Last weekend I did a nice update so all projects utilise version control and are based over at github.
