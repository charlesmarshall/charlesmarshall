With recent projects I needed a flexible modal box. Most of the ones out there are either horribly bloated or only work for images, which really sucks when you want a form inside one. I decided the best route would be to write a quick one myself. You can leave feed back etc via the jQuery doc page (which is "here":http://plugins.jquery.com/project/SmartModal).
