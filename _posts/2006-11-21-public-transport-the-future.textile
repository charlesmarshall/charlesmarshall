title: Public Transport: The Future?
category: rant
---
Living in my new flat I'm in the precarious position of being nearto many forms of public transport. With bus stops as far as the eye cansee and just beyond that is the train station.p. During my university days I used public transport almost exclusivelyto get back and forth. Most of the time it was the train, which meantusing New Street.p. With thousands of trains coming and going day in day out there arebound to be the odd delay, which is acceptable. However, when thesedelays are caused by miss-management and poor control systems somethingneeds to be done.p. For many years there has been talk about giving New Street anoverhaul. In the latest bout of proposals New Street gets another setof platforms, a lofty makeover and a sparkly lick of paint.p. While this is great for the artisans amongst us the practical sideof me wonders if these improvements will be more then skin deep. Willthey finally dump the cash-sucking Windows and jump onto the OpenSource bandwagon?p. Although I창%u20AC?%u201E?m not a regular 창%u20AC?%u0153user창%u20AC?%u201E?, I must admit the bus service byme is annoying regular (all those buses driving by really messes withmy tv reception!). With some nice new touches, such as location ofwhere the next bus is and its eta, maybe buses are the way forward?p. Or maybe not. Even if there were massive improvements to public transport, the chances are I창%u20AC?%u201E?d still take the car!
