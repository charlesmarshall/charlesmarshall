      <h1>MG Site Redesign</h1>
      <h4 class='date'>5<sup>th</sup> April 2012</h4>
      <p><a href="http://oneblackbear.com">One Black Bear</a> were invited to and won the pitch to rebuid MGs UK website. It was a horrible flash site reminisent of the 90s, so lots of work needed.</p>
      <p>With their announcement that MG would be entering in to the BTCC championship for 2012 the race was on to get the site done and live before the first race weekend of the season on the 31st of March.</p>
      <p>Several long days and help from my colleage Ross Riley we got it done on time.</p>

    <section class='feature' id="process">
      <h2>Design process</h2>
      <p>We went though several versions of the MG site to get a stlye and layout that the client was happy with and worked well with the content we had. In the gallery above you can see some of the different versions of the home page along with some of the finalised designs for hte desktop version of the site.</p>
    </section>

    <section class='feature' id="lemon-squeezy">
      <h2>Easy to update</h2>
      <p>The version of the MG site we replaced was problematic to update and in some places could only be changed by a developer familar with the website. Obviously, this is not a good thing.</p>
      <p>We built the site on <a href="/projects/wildfire/6.pretty/">Wildfire v6.pretty</a> and included some of the newest modules for handling navigation systems, extenstive vehicle data and the like. The site is almost all controlled via the CMS with only a few elements (social media links etc) being out of their control.</p>
      <p>This allows them to publish news, event data and even race results while on the road and at any time of the day.</p>
    </section>

    <section class='feature' id="adjustable">
      <h2>Responsiveness</h2>
      <p>With MG entering the BTCC we expect traffic spikes during race weekends and a large percentage of mobile visitors. By making the website using responsive technologies we can provide a good experience for all.</p>
    </section>
    <section class='feature' id="adjustable">
      <h2>Tablet layout</h2>
      <p>These days iPads and similar devices are almost the same resolution as most peoples desktop browsers and in some cases bigger. The main concern is making sure the key CTAs are visible on landscape orientation, where less height is availble.</p>
      <p>In most cases the MG site has the primary CTAs in the headers or banner section of the page; have a look in the gallery below</p>

    </section>
    <section class='feature' id="adjustable">
      <h2>Mobile layout</h2>
      <p>With a much smaller area than both desktop and tablet devices we have to reduce the content being displayed. The other reason to drop off some of the larger images is to reduce the strain on the devices internet connection, as it is very likely to be running on standard edge or 3g rather than wifi.</p>

    <section class='feature' id="the-king">
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>I alluded to this just above, but one of hte big things with product based websites is to provide information to the consumer. In the car market more than 80% of people will check the vehicle out online before viewing in person, so it's vital the website is accurate and informative.</p>
      <p>With this site we've taken all the information we had and arranged it into logical sections and split over some tables; which is pretty standard. On top of this however, we have added some stand out features. Key points about the vehicle that are displayed at a much larger size  away from the table to provide quick headline information for the user.</p>
