      <h1>Wildfire CMS version 6.pretty</h1>
      <p>Although <a href="/projects/wildfire/6/">version 6</a> had many big architecture changes it was mostly designed on the fly by myself while I was building it, and it shows.</p>
      <p>This time, an actual designer was involved. As it was a couple of years ago (think late 2011, early 2012) there are plently of shadows, gradients and rounded corners as that was in vogue at the time.</p>
      <p>This darker look and feel gave a much slicker feel than previous iterations. With the large, chunky and brightly coloured buttons for primary actions we tried to give obvious signs of what is important on the page.</p>

    <section class='feature' id="fix-it">
      <h2>Not just a pretty face</h2>
      <p>After we'd been using <a href="/projects/wildfire/6/">Wildfire v6</a> we found a few ways to improve the speed a little as it was suffering with larger tree structures.</p>
      <p>A few other small tweaks were made, like removing hard-coded class names &amp; making use of the internal primary key name rather than directly calling it 'id' (there are still a few of those around to this day!)</p>
    </section>

    <section class='feature' id="stability">
      <h2>Keeping it steady</h2>
      <p>Even though this is classed as a major release, it has maintained almost all of the same infrastructure as <a href="/projects/wildfire/6/">v6</a>, giving it a nice stable &amp; well tested code base.</p>
      <p>With the swap over to tree structures on content and event based system inside the controllers, most future changes are planned to be smaller, but more frequent.</p>
      <p>We may end up moving away from the traditional point release naming convention and go to hashs... we'll see.</p>
    </section>

    <section class='feature' id="plugins-galore">
      <h2>The joy of extending</h2>
      <p>Now the new tree layout has a fair few miles under it's belt and is now the default setup for a couple of major versions it meant our plugins became easier to update &amp; reuse.</p>
      <p>The differences between a <a href="/projects/wildfire/6/">v6</a> site and a <a href="/projects/wildfire/6.pretty/">v6.pretty</a> being small enough that most plugins built for one will work on the other. In the few cases where they don't the changes are normally simple enough to do.</p>
      <p>Now there is a stable underpinning, we have quite a lot more plugins for more of the common functions needed. Covering off things such as sitemaps, archive style navigation and many more.</p>
