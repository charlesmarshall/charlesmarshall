      <h1>National Express Careers</h1>
      <h4 class='date'>14<sup>th</sup> May 2013</h4>
      <p>A back-seat driver is a term most road users know all too well. Be it a friend, family member or just someone along for the ride, I'm sure you've experienced the exaggerated moans when braking sharply or a disdainful look after going too quickly over a speed bump. Now imagine 50 of them....</p>
      <p>The job of a bus driver is a thankless one; rarely complimented, but regularly besmirched by passengers and other road users alike. Yet it is a vital role to the <a href="/blog/mapping-bus-stops-and-routes/">infrastructure of the region, with millions of people relying on them</a>. It really does take a dedicated person to do the job well and they are hard to find.</p>
      <p>With National Express running over 75% of the regions bus routes, that translates to needing thousands of bus drivers. Each one is trained to a national standard with professional accreditations, regular performance checks, extra training for the British weather and much, much more. To ensure all of this runs smoothly there is a dedicated department for recruitment and training.</p>

    <section class='feature' >


 <p>Over the course of a year this department will process around 10,000 applications, have more than 4,000 interviews and finally hire in the region of 400 new drivers. With the current fiscal climate, these numbers are on the increase. More people are travelling by bus, creating extra demand for routes and services and with job security (we're always going to need buses in some form) and a solid pay packet, the job is becoming more appealing.</p>
 <p>Recruitment &amp; HR are areas that we had previously only dipped our toes in; a regimented world of paperwork, due process, legal documents and maybe even the dreaded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPS_report">TPS reports</a>. It was time to get our hands dirty and learn about the ins and outs of this demanding world.</p>
 <p>Over the course of several meetings with the recruitment team we got to grips with how they work, the information and data they need and what functionality required of the new system they needed us to develop.</p>
 <h3>The Application</h3>
 <p>Let's start at the first step; the application form itself. The previous online and offline versions were an intimidating wall of text. Here we can really help, taking cues from our e-commerce expertise, if you want people to provide you information you have to make it simple, with as little friction as possible.</p>
 <p>A lot of people will look at large forms, with dozens of poorly marked fields and feel anxious, being unsure of what and how to fill them in. Just glancing at something like a passport renewal form is enough for some of us to break in to a sweat. That frame of mind really isn't conducive for a job application - worrying how to do something or rushing it to get it out of the way is always counter productive.</p>
 <p>Removing that initial shock of a never-ending series of tightly packed boxes and instead gently coaxing people though the early stages, giving them small chunks at a time, while getting them used to your interface piece by piece, you will get a much higher completion rate. By splitting the form down to a step-by-step, grouping related questions and even changing the first few questions to be just yes or no buttons, the process is straight forward and mostly friendly (tough questions are always going to be tough though).</p>
 <p>Utilising space in a design is important, whether it be a shortage or an excess. In our case we are trying to clearly display a form, so a good quantity of margining provides a clean and almost sparse look to the forms. This emptiness, even when there are complex elements inside, provides a fa&ccedil;ade of simplicity and tries to trick you into thinking you have virtually nothing to do.</p>
 <p>The cherry on top of this data-cake is the information it presents back to you. By showing the percentage you've completed, pre-filling your answers where possible and giving you the ability to quickly go back or forwards; making the form very user friendly.</p>
 <h3>Not All Jobs Are The Same</h3>
 <p>The jobs being advertised vary wildly from the standard bus driver role (used as the example) to positions like the Head of Operations for engineering. To make that possible, the system had to be flexible and easy to use.</p>
 <p>By building on our existing form creation technology, we were able to put together a building block style system. Adding each question and asking if it is a date field, an email etc. specifying if it is a required entry, if there's a repeatable option and more.</p>
 <p>That can still be a pain-staking task when you have a position that needs 50 plus questions to be asked; so we added in the ability to make clones. Now all you have to do is add or remove the extra questions and you're done; much faster than making it from scratch each time.</p>
 <h3>Due Process</h3>
 <p>Once an application has been completed, email alerts are sent out to the relevant people and the administrative group will fly in to action. One of the team will read and vet the applicant and decide if they are a suitable candidate, they then move the person along to first interview. More emails get sent.</p>
 <p>After a meeting is setup, generally with several other candidates attending, the foibles, test scores, positives &amp; negatives are all noted down and decisions are made on who to bring back; it's a lot like X-Factor, but without the special effects and chicken songs. Of course, more emails are then sent.</p>
 <p>The lucky few that make it to the driving assessment are tested again. This time on the skid pan, in the car park and along narrow roads, making sure they can cut it on the mean streets of the West Midlands, Coventry and Dundee. Emails are sent out letting them know one way or the other.</p>
 <h3>Emails</h3>
 <p>You might have noticed that there are a lot of emails being used. It makes it easy; everything sent out to an applicant can be seen on the system and tracked back to who and when.</p>
 <p>In order to do this we have to have a very flexible template system; allowing for anything from a meeting invite to a test result. By using the concept of mail-merge but placing it within the realm of an online system and tying it in across all our data models, any email can be personalised to say exactly what you need it to.</p>
 <h3>Hard Copy</h3>
 <p>Within the process, there are occasions when there might not be a computer to use or an internet connection that works; sometimes you need it on a piece of paper. To facilitate that we have a range of dynamic PDF downloads, covering everything from meeting sign in sheets, applicant summaries and more. The majority of these are tailored to fit their existing templates, so logos, matching names and fields are used - keeping the process consistent wherever we can.</p>
 <h3>History</h3>
 <p>As you can imagine, with all of these downloads &amp; emails going around, there needs to be a record of what is happening, so each applicant has an abridged history of its existence to go with it. You can look and find when emails were sent, who sent them and even the exact content of the email. Any extra actions such as hirings or rejections are added in as well.</p>
 <p>By the end of the process you have a good listing of everything relevant to that person; extremely useful when you're fielding phone calls about job interviews or why you didn't invite someone to one.</p>
 <h3>Safeguarding Equality</h3>
 <p>With any system that handles such a large amount of data, precautions have to be taken to ensure integrity and security; what those measures are depends on the information you are handling. Financial data has the most stringent laws around it, but the personal details being collected by this kind of process is the next rung down.</p>
 <p>Having created the National Express online sales portal for their ticketing systems, there was no problem with the security side of things. However, this was the first time we had worked with employment and equal opportunity laws.</p>
 <p>Even though every job application form asks for sensitive information such as ethnic origin, age and gender, discrimination laws ensure these are not used when making a decision on who to offer a job to. By hiding all the answers from those questions throughout the entire CMS, the only information that can be found for these is in the anonymous statistics report in the form of percentage based pie charts.</p>
 <h3>Data Protection</h3>
 <p>Privacy is always viewed as a serious concern and to comply with data protection and employment law, all data on applicants can only be kept for a certain period of time; in this case seven months. We have an automated method that scans the data on the system, isolates those outside of the allowed window and neatly removes them from the database and any associated files.</p>
 <h3>Always Evolving</h3>
 <p>As usage grows and the needs change, we grow the system with it. Based on <a href="/projects/wildfire/">our modular CMS</a> adding and amending the functionality is straight forward and flexible. We've recently added in new features such as applicant highlights; a summary of critical information on a person which shows the main first round criteria in a very visible way.</p>
 <p>We'll be working closely with the teams at National Express Bus to drive the system forward, improving and increasing the system capabilities as we go. You could say this is a job we're looking forward to making a career out of.</p>
